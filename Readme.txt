"I have started a series to solve the NeetCode roadmap. I will provide a link to the series on GitHub. I will provide free access to code and exercises on GitHub to help everyone understand the topics. This way, anyone can learn DSA for free, and I will also solve related problems for each topic. Today's topic was Day-01 Array and Hashing (Dynamic Array). I have added lessons and exercises for it."
